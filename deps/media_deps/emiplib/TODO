 * If no messages are passed (e.g. when a source is no longer transmitting
   data, the push member function will not be called, and no timeouts will
   be performed
   -> add a virtual function to indicate when a new iteration starts?
   -> or just pass a nullptr message? (this would mean that _all_ existing
      components need to be modified to be able to handle this)

 * Add codecs for video.
 * Improve the ALSA output component.
 * Add 8-bit sample support to the ESD output component.
 * Rewrite the audio session to allow a choice between available input 
   and output components.
